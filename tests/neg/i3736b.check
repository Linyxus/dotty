[21..27..48] in i3736b.scala
extension of type scala.Dynamic needs to be enabled
by making the implicit value scala.language.dynamics visible.
This can be achieved by adding the import clause 'import scala.language.dynamics'
or by setting the compiler option -language:dynamics.
See the Scala docs for value scala.language.dynamics for a discussion
why the feature needs to be explicitly enabled.
