<201..201> in i1639.scala
None of the overloaded alternatives of constructor Foo in class Foo with types
 (): Foo
 ()(implicit bar: String): Foo
match arguments (String("baz"))
<84..84> in i1639.scala
no implicit argument of type String was found for parameter x of method f in class Bar.
I found:

    this.f(/* missing */implicitly[String])

But method f in class Bar produces a diverging implicit search when trying to match type String.
