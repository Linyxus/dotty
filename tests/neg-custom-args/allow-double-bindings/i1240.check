Double definition:
def foo(x: test.D): test.D in class X at line 24 and
def foo(x: test.D): test.D in class X at line 25
have the same type after erasure.
<190..190> in i1240.scala
cannot merge
  method foo in class C of type (x: T): Unit  and
  method foo in class C of type (x: test.D): Unit
they are both defined in class C but have matching signatures
  (x: test.D): Unit and
  (x: test.D): Unit
as members of type test.C[test.D]
