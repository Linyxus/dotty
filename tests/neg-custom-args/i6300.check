<161..161> in i6300.scala
no implicit argument of type Test.Foo[Test.Bar] was found for parameter ev of method implicitly in object DottyPredef.
I found:

    Test.i[T](/* missing */implicitly[Test.Foo[Test.Foo[T]]])

But method i in object Test produces a diverging implicit search when trying to match type Test.Foo[Test.Foo[T]].
